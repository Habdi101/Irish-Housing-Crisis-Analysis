# 🇮🇪 Ireland Housing Crisis Analysis  
### Rents, Supply & Affordability (2016–2024)

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Ireland is experiencing one of the most serious housing crises in its history. Rents have increased rapidly, housing supply remains constrained, and affordability pressures are spreading beyond Dublin into regional counties.

This project provides an **end-to-end data analysis** of Ireland’s housing market using official **RTB** and **CSO** data. The goal is to understand how rents, housing supply, and affordability have changed over time and how these trends differ across counties.

The analysis is designed to support **data-driven decision-making** for public bodies, councils, financial institutions, and housing stakeholders.

---

## 🏘️ Business Context
Rising housing costs affect:
- Households and renters  
- Local authorities and planners  
- Banks and mortgage providers  
- Employers and workforce mobility  

Despite frequent public discussion, clear data-driven insight is often missing.  
This project uses trusted national datasets to answer practical questions about where pressure is highest, whether supply is improving, and what trends suggest for future planning.

---

## ❓ Key Questions Explored
- How quickly are rents increasing across Ireland?  
- Which counties are becoming the least affordable?  
- Is housing supply keeping up with demand?  
- Is Dublin still the most affected area, or are other counties catching up?  
- What do the trends suggest for policy and business decisions?

## 📈 Key Findings (Summary)
- Rent levels have increased sharply since 2020, with several counties outside Dublin experiencing faster growth rates.  
- Housing supply growth has not matched demand in high-pressure areas.  
- Affordability pressure is no longer limited to Dublin and is spreading to commuter and regional counties.  
- Regional inequality in housing costs has widened over time.

## 📊 Dashboard & Visual Outputs
The Power BI dashboard presents:
- Rent trends by county and property type  
- Housing supply changes over time  
- Rent-to-income affordability indicators  
- Regional comparisons using maps and charts
